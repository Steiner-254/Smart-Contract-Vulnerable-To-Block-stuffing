Smart Contract Vulnerable To Block stuffing

# Description
~ Block stuffing is a type of attack on the Ethereum network where an attacker tries to fill blocks with unnecessary transactions to disrupt the network or gain some advantage. It's important to note that block stuffing is a malicious activity and should not be encouraged or used.

# vulnerable.sol
~ This simple contract allows users to deposit Ether into their accounts and withdraw it later. However, it has a vulnerability that can be exploited in a block stuffing attack. The vulnerability lies in the withdraw function, specifically in the use of the msg.sender.call{value: amount}("") line.

~ In a block stuffing attack, an attacker may repeatedly call the withdraw function with a small amount of Ether, causing many transactions to be executed within a single block. This can result in higher gas consumption for miners and slow down the Ethereum network. Additionally, the require(sent, "Failed to send Ether") line may not revert the transaction if the attacker's call to msg.sender fails, potentially allowing them to drain the contract's balance.

# fix.sol
~ To protect against block stuffing and reentrancy attacks, it's essential to use the latest best practices and security measures when designing and developing smart contracts. In fix.sol example, we improve the contract's security by following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and using the transfer function instead of a low-level call.
